# OWBUnits
Current version: 0.3.1

Features:
* Includes a custom unit symbol for all units in the game: robots, super-mutants, ghouls, mirelurks, dogs, power armor, etc.
* Includes MPU Units-like custom division symbols in company/battalion/regiment sizes.
* Uses custom unit symbols at all levels including in tech screens.

Notes:
* You must have "Use NATO Symbols" turned on for this to work.
* A few custom template assignments for built-in divisions (e.g. Troll Warren's "Wood Monsters") have been eliminated; all starting and template divisions for the AI (and for all countries at start up) will default to the automatic template selected by unit composition.
* with regard to unit size on the custom templates, most starting units in the game are barely company/squadron/battery-sized (80â€“250 manpower) by current standards. A unit with at least 20 width might classify as a battalion (300-1000 manpower). Only the very largest units (all the boxes filled) would probably count as a regiment.

To-do:
* the category symbols for ships and air are not set in the base OWB mod, I want to replace them
* category symbols for some categories (e.g. all mutants, leg infantry vs. all infantry, etc.) are not really correct in all cases, need to be updated
* add custom symbols for army groups in regiment/brigade/division sizes.
* add colored custom symbols (e.g. red for Legion) similar to MPU mods
* assign custom symbols to all templates/units for all countries

Feedback is welcome!
